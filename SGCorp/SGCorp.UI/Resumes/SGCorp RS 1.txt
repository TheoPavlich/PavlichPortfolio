	We need to be able to give these employees a link to the Submit Suggestion page.  Add a route
	configuration to have a url that looks something like:  <localhost:port>/suggestion
	This should load the page.  Since we are not actually implementing security at this point, don't 
	worry that the menu is available.  We can restrict this at a later time.
